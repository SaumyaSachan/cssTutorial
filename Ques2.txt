Ques 2 -  Explain the difference between absolute and relative positions.
SOl -   
   1) position: absolute;
    An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned 
    ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

    However, if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, 
    it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
    Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.

   2) An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
      Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to 
      be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

    EX - 

    div.relative {
    position: relative;
    width: 400px;
    height: 200px;
    border: 3px solid #73AD21;
    }

    div.absolute {
    position: absolute;
    top: 80px;
    right: 0;
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    border: 3px solid #73AD21;
    }
